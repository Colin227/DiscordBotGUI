# DiscordBotGUI

This is a bot written in python using the discord.py api wrapper. It fetches the weather, stock information and random jokes. It is still a work in progress, and improvements are being added.

This was my first experience working with multithreading. I had used a single threaded approach but found that the GUI would hang while the bot was running the event loop waiting for server messages. 

The GUI was made using pyqt5 and is just a simple user interface to start and stop the bot.
It is based off the character Bender from Futurama.

Custom images and gifs that the bot responds with are not in the repo due to copyright.

User information is also stored in a separate file to keep usernames/locations private.
